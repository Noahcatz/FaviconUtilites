# Thanks for using Favicon Utilities!

Hi! This is my first extension, made of pure sweat and tears (Literally)



## What it does

This extension changes the little icon on top of pages, called favicons!

## How it works

This extension changes the pages favicon with some cleaver JavaScript work.
It inserts a new html element that changes the favicon. 

## How to report bugs
If there's any bugs, please dm or contact me on the discord form.

### Known bugs:
-When using the "revert to original" block, if the website URL doesn't start with www, it wont do anything. In this case, please use the change block and enter the website favicon location.
